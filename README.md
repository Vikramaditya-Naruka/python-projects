I've worked on a variety of Python projects that showcase my skills in both game development and utility applications.
These projects include creating a Caesar Cipher for encryption and decryption, 
developing games like Snake, Treasure Hunt, and Turtle Racing, and building useful tools like a password generator, coffee machine program, and a Pomodoro timer.
Additionally, you've explored text analysis and personalized applications like a birthday wisher.
